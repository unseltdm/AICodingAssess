## Design a Scalable Twitter Clone in the Cloud

Imagine you are tasked with building a basic Twitter clone in the cloud (using GCP or another
cloud platform).
1) Define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Start by outlining a basic set of features that
you would include in a minimal version of the application. What core functionality must
be supported?
2) Identify Required Cloud Resources: Describe the cloud resources you would use to build
and deploy this MVP. How would you connect and configure them?
3) Scaling Strategy: After launching the MVP, explain how you would scale the system to
handle growing user traffic. What resources or architectural changes would be
necessary for scaling?
4) Additional Features & Considerations: As the application grows, new features might be
added. Discuss any potential additional features and the cloud resources you would
need to support them.
5) Key Questions: What critical questions would you need to address as you plan the
systemâ€™s architecture and scaling strategy?
