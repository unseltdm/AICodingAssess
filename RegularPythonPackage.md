**Describe a Python package that you use regularly.** 

What are the most useful class/methods/functions? What are the limitations, gotchas, 
bugs in the package? Can you white-board a strategy that might work to improve the 
package? We are interested in how well you know your tools and how interested you 
are in improving stuff you use.
