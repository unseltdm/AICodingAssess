**SQL/GBQ Challenge 1: Analyzing Genomic Data for Disease Association**

_Background:_

You are working on a bioinformatics platform that analyzes genomic data to find associations
between genetic variants and diseases. You have access to a dataset containing information
about genetic variants, patients, and their disease status.

_Dataset:_

You have two tables in your BigQuery dataset:
- variants:
  - variant_id (STRING): Unique identifier for the genetic variant.
  - chromosome (STRING): Chromosome where the variant is located.
  - position (INTEGER): Position on the chromosome.
  - reference_allele (STRING): Reference allele.
  - alternate_allele (STRING): Alternate allele.
- patients:
  - patient_id (STRING): Unique identifier for the patient.
  - variant_id (STRING): Identifier for the genetic variant (foreign key to
variants.variant_id).
  - disease_status (STRING): Disease status of the patient ('diseased' or
'healthy').

_Task:_

Write a SQL query to identify the top 5 genetic variants that are most strongly associated with
the disease. The association is measured by the difference in the frequency of the variant
between diseased and healthy patients.

_Steps:_

- Calculate the frequency of each variant in diseased patients.
- Calculate the frequency of each variant in healthy patients.
- Compute the absolute difference in frequencies for each variant.
- Return the top 5 variants with the highest absolute difference in frequencies.

_Expected Output:_

The query should return the following columns:
- variant_id: The unique identifier for the genetic variant.
- diseased_frequency: The frequency of the variant in diseased patients.
- healthy_frequency: The frequency of the variant in healthy patients.
- frequency_difference: The absolute difference in frequencies between diseased and
healthy patients.

_Notes:_

- Ensure that your query handles cases where a variant might be present in only diseased
or only healthy patients.
- Consider edge cases where the number of patients is very small or where variants are
extremely rare.
